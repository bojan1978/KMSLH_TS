System automation


The most basic and in the same time the most important part of any application is its basic functionality and the thing that is actually generating income for the company.
For example, the sites for purchasing things must have at all times functional pages for paying transactions. For hotels and restaurants, the bookings and reservations, etc.
So, identifying the core of the application (in most cases the source of the income) must be automated or covered with the most percentage of automated tests.
Ideally, these kinds of tests should be running periodically, independent of deployment process, especially in the cases where there are integrations with third parties (for example banks, in case of purchasing sites). In this manner you will be aware of the state of the most important part of the application at any time, even if everything is ok from your end , a failure of the system from any other end (a third party) can cause you damage.\

From a testing process it is always good practice to have any type of smoke test automated and include it in deployment process, with notifications to the persons involved (developer, product owner, QA). In that way, if any new feature or a bugfix is breaking the existing state of the application, the least amount of time will be lost to identify the problem. (and not wait for the manual testing of the application to discover the issue)
